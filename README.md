### Overview

This is a 'quirky' version of my CV [that you can find a hosted version of at http://portfolio.howe.pm/cv/](http://portfolio.howe.pm/cv/).



It is a simple page made to look like an IDE which I hope appeals to techies;  I used SASS and CofeeScript (as I usually do) for pre-processors and then just normal HTML trickery!



It could use some cleaning up as I didn't originally plan on releasing the source code in this manner, but it doesn't really matter - I will clean it up a bit in the next commit or two and it's just to give you an idea of some of my coding abilities.



A screenshot is available, although I think visiting the live site may be a little better.
